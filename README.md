## Installation

This is a deployed site so there is no need for any installation. If you are looking to clone and run the site on your localhost, be sure to install all required dependencies using `npm i`.

## Usage

This budget tracker allows the user to add and subtract funds to their budget account as desired.

The main advantage of this budget tracker is that it supports offline functionality. If you lose internet access, you can still interact with your budget: all of you changes will be saved to the local IndexedDB. Once internet access is regained, all changes in IndexedDB will be transfered over to the MongoDB hosted in Mongo Atlas.

Additionally, this site is a Progressive Web Application. You can download the site for local use (onto your desktop or mobile device) by clicking the download option in the URL bar.
